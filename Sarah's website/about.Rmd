I started my academic journey as a research assistant in the Developmental Decision Making Lab at St. Norbert College. Eager to gain more research experience, I completed my Master's degree at the University of Chicago where I joined the Honesty, Morality, & Ethics (HoME) Lab and the Human Nature & Potentials Lab. 



After competing my Master's degree, I worked as a lab manager in the Center for Decision Research. During my time there, I had the opportunity to oversee the Pop-up Labs, help create and run the Virtual Lab, and help create the world's first behavioral science discovery center, Mindworks.



Currently, I'm a PhD student in the  Management/OB area at the University of Utah's David Eccles School of Business.  

 

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy playing the flute, rock climbing, and spending time with friends and family.
